// Story Text

#StoryText00100,At the end of our usual deal the broker made me a strange offer.
#StoryText00150,She suggested we work together.
#StoryText00200,It's risky, but if I work with her, in the continent's top criminal organization,<br>I'll have opportunity to make a lot of money.
#StoryText00300,So I accepted her offer immediately.
#StoryText00350,I have nothing to lose after all...

#StoryText00400,Well...<BR>I need to put you through a test before I entrust the job to you.
#StoryText00500,Let's see if you can make profit for our organization.
#StoryText00600,After that I'll leave the management to you.
#StoryText00700,If you are profitable in <color=#FFFF00>50 days</color>, you can keep this place.
#StoryText00750,Don't worry, I'll help you at first.
#StoryText00760,Let's start by breeding and selling monsters.

#StoryText00800,You need cages for both monsters and slaves.
#StoryText00900,Build a slave cage.
#StoryText01000,Build a monster cage.

#StoryText01100,Good job, I'm gifting you a slave and a monster.
#StoryText01200,Try not to kill them off.
#StoryText01300,Slaves and monsters have different looks and races.
#StoryText01400,Also, each race has different traits, so try to breed the best slaves possible. 

#StoryText01500,<color=#FFFF00>Human</color> girls have few magic properties, but they make good whores.<BR>Individual traits: <color=#63E057>Conception Chance +5%</color>, <color=#63E057>Growth Time -5s</color>, <color=#E07369>Maximum Health -15</color>, <color=#E07369>Maximum births -3</color>
#StoryText01600,<color=#FFFF00>Goblins</color> are a common race that has a short mating time.<BR>Individual traits: <color=#63E057>Growth Time -5s</color>, <color=#E07369>Conception Chance -5%</color>

#StoryText02550,Now let me explain you how to <color=#FFFF00>breed</color> them.
#StoryText02600,First build a breeding room.
#StoryText02700,Then move the monster into the room.
#StoryText02800,And finally move the slave into the same room.
#StoryText02900,Here we go.<BR>They should take it from here. Once she is pregnant, make full use of the offspring.

#StoryText03000,Now let's talk about <color=#FFFF00>selling</color> and <color=#FFFF00>buying</color>.
#StoryText03100,If you want to <color=#FFFF00>sell slaves or monsters</color>, drag them to my <color=#FFFF00>carriage</color>.

#StoryText03200,Want to buy a new product?
#StoryText03300,One moment...
#StoryText03400,I work during the <color=#FFFF00>day</color> hours as a legitimate <color=#FFFF00>slave</color> trader.
#StoryText03500,If you want to purchase a <color=#FFFF00>monster</color>, wait until <color=#FFFF00>night</color>.
#StoryText03600,That's because trading monsters is frowned upon.
#StoryText03700,If you want to buy a monster or a slave, just <color=#FFFF00>drag</color> the product and <color=#FFFF00>drop</color> them into the <color=#FFFF00>right room</color>.
#StoryText03800,You can also quickly <color=#FFFF00>sell and buy</color> them using this <color=#FFFF00>quick menu</color>.

#StoryText25200,From now on, I will make sure to receive <color=#FFFF00>reimbursement</color> once <color=#FFFF00>every 5 days</color>.
#StoryText25300,But rather than money, I prefer <color=#FFFF00>monsters</color>.
#StoryText25400,So I will let you provide them to me instead.
#StoryText25500,Amilia waits for a <color=#FFFF00>monster acquisition</color> once <color=#FFFF00>every 5 days</color>.
#StoryText25600,The monsters to be given will be mentioned by Amilia in advance,<br>and on the 5th day, you must <color=#FFFF00>pay by transferring the monsters to her</color>.
#StoryText25700,If you <color=#FFFF00>fail even a single payment</color>, it will be <color=#FF0000>Game Over</color>.

#StoryText05000,Have you finished? Manage it well until <color=#FFFF00>day 50</color>.
#StoryText05100,If you make a lot of money, we will let you keep this place.
#StoryText05200,You can also enjoy watching the slaves breed many children.
#StoryText05300,If the profits are huge, you can even take over the organization.
#StoryText05350,Oh, and lastly, don't mind the basement, as it was built by the previous owner and doesn't mean much.
#StoryText05400,Then do your best, my dear new co-worker♥

#StoryText06500,The slaves can <color=#FFFF00>infect monsters</color> and eventually <color=#550000>die</color>.
#StoryText06600,Please note that <color=#FFFF00>infected monsters</color> gain <color=#FF0000>erectile dysfunction</color> and can no longer reproduce.

#StoryText12200,Let me introduce you to my <color=#FFFF00>business partner</color> here.
#StoryText12300,Her name is <color=#C27AEB>Flora</color>. She'll be in charge of dismantling monsters and slaves.
#StoryText12400,Nice to meet you~
#StoryText12500,If you <color=#FFFF00>dismantle</color> them, you'll get <color=#FFFF00>by-products</color>.
#StoryText12600,<color=#FFFF00>By-products</color> can be <color=#FFFF00>sold</color> or used in <color=#FFFF00>item making</color>.
#StoryText12700,Now you know.<br>So please call her whenever you need her services.
#StoryText12800,Don't shy from doing it often.

#StoryText12900,Hello~!
#StoryText13000,I'll show you how to use my dismantling services.
#StoryText13100,<color=#FFFF00>Drag&drop monsters and slaves</color> here and they will be queued for <color=#FFFF00>dismantling</color>.
#StoryText13200,Once the process is complete, you can obtain rare <color=#FFFF00>by-products</color>.
#StoryText13210,If you dismantle a lot, a special <color=#FFFF00>pixie</color> will be created.
#StoryText13220,Pixies are good at helping and will <color=#FFFF00>automatically manage slaves</color>.
#StoryText13300,Grinding up creatures makes me so wet. Hurry up and make a lot of pixies!

#StoryText13400,Let me introduce you to my other <color=#FFFF00>business partner</color>.
#StoryText13500,Her name is <color=#4DF4E4>Noel</color>.<br>She'll be responsible for the synthesis of potions and elixirs.
#StoryText13600,Umm, good day.
#StoryText13700,She can <color=#FFFF00>make various items</color> by <color=#FFFF00>combining by-products</color>.
#StoryText14000,Make lots of useful potions.
#StoryText14100,Call me when you decide what to make.

#StoryText14200,Thank you for wasting your time on someone like me.
#StoryText14300,I will now show you how to use my services.
#StoryText14400,Click on this dusty <color=#FFFF00>cauldron</color> to see what can be made.
#StoryText14500,<color=#FFFF00>Potions</color> can be synthesized from there.
#StoryText14600,Once their production is <color=#FFFF00>complete</color>, items will be <color=#FFFF00>acquired automatically</color>.
#StoryText14800,Let's start experimenting!

#StoryText14900,You can use achievement points and upgrade NPC capabilities.
#StoryText15000,There is no order of upgrades, you can do it however you want.

#StoryText16400,A new above-ground facility has been added.
#StoryText16600,From now on, this place will provide new services to our clients.

#StoryText16700,It's your deadline now.
#StoryText16800,It seems you have failed to make a profit. The opposite, in fact.
#StoryText16900,Hmm... I think I misjudged you.
#StoryText17000,It can't be helped...
#StoryText17100,You must be disposed of now.
#StoryText17200,Then- goodbye...

#StoryText17300,Not bad.
#StoryText17400,You have succeeded.
#StoryText17500,Let's do it just as well in the future...
#StoryText17600,My dear co-worker♥
#StoryText17700,You can now enjoy free-play mode.
#StoryText17800,There's still a lot possibilities to the game. Thanks for playing!

#StoryText04500,Looks like the slave got <color=#FFFF00>pregnant</color>. Wonderful! Slaves love being impregnated against their will.
#StoryText04600,Build a delivery room to give <color=#FFFF00>birth</color> to new girls and monsters.
#StoryText04700,If the <color=#FFFF00>father</color> is a <color=#FFFF00>monster</color>, the <color=#FFFF00>baby</color> will be <color=#FFFF00>monster</color> too. The same goes for human fathers. 
#StoryText04800,Build a delivery room.
#StoryText04900,Move the slave to the delivery room for her to give birth.

#StoryText06700,The slave have given birth to a baby.
#StoryText06710,Move the child to the cage.
#StoryText06800,You can <color=#FFFF00>pump breast milk</color> from pregnant or recently pregnant slaves.
#StoryText06900,Let me show you how to do it.
#StoryText07000,Build a milking room first.
#StoryText07100,Move the slave to the milking room.
#StoryText07200,Breast <color=#FFFF00>milk</color> is produced when a slave is <color=#FFFF00>pregnant or after she gives birth</color>.

#StoryText07300,Click on the milk tank to collect a milk bottle.
#StoryText09500,Clicking on the milk tank inside the milking room allows you to receive the milk.
#StoryText09600,The tank stores a large amount of milk, so click on it to get milk as needed.

#StoryText09700,Slaves' <color=#AA0000>health decreases</color> when breeding with monsters and they <color=#550000>die</color> when it reaches 0.
#StoryText09800,It's good idea to <color=#FFFF00>restore their health</color> by letting the them rest in a <color=#FFFF00>slave cage</color> before they die out.

#StoryText25800,I have received the delivery.
#StoryText25900,Well done. In return, I'll reward you.
#StoryText26000,Select a <color=#FFFF00>slave category</color> to be <color=#FFFF00>special offer</color>.
#StoryText26100,You could <color=#FFFF00>buy at 50%</color> and <color=#FFFF00>sell at 150%</color> for the category of your choice.
#StoryText26200,I will give you this offer for the entire day.
#StoryText26300,Here's your next goal...
#StoryText26400,See you in five days.

#StoryText27300,Thanks to your hard work, a <color=#FFFF00>pixie</color> was created.
#StoryText27400,You can take care of the slaves more easily if you use them~

#StoryText27500,If you <color=#FFFF00>dismantle</color> more than a <color=#FFFF00>certain number of creatures</color>,<br>a <color=#FFFF00>pixie</color> is created and it will take care of your slaves automatically.
#StoryText27600,Pixies freely fly around and perform the following services:
#StoryText27900,When a slave's health falls below a certain value, she's moved<br>to a nearby slave cage to recover and then back to the original room.
#StoryText28000,When a slave becomes pregnant, she's moved to a nearby<br>delivery room to give birth then back to the original room.
#StoryText28050,Babies are moved from delivery rooms to an empty cage.
#StoryText28100,When the slave's milk is full, she is moved to a nearby<br>milking room for milking then back to the original room.
#StoryText28200,One pixie can only handle one task at a time, and as number<br>of slaves and monsters increases, more of them may be needed.

#StoryText29100,Oh, did you get something interesting?
#StoryText29200,You can use this DNA to create <color=#FFFF00>monster or slave</color> with <color=#FFFF00>randomized traits</color>.
#StoryText29250,Appearance and traits are random. If you get lucky, you can get a super-slave.
#StoryText29300,If you put the DNA here, it can become whatever you want,<br>whether it's a girl or a monster~
#StoryText29400,You can get special <color=#FFFF00>DNA</color> items from <color=#FFFF00>dismantling</color>.<br>If you offer them to Noel, you can create slaves or monsters with a variety of traits.
#StoryText29500,There are <color=#FFFF00>monsters</color> that can only be obtained<br>through <color=#FFFF00>origin DNA</color>, so try to get it.

#StoryText29600,Darling~, what you ordered is complete~
#StoryText29700,Here you go~

#StoryText29800,Oh, long time no see?
#StoryText29900,You can make anything with this~
#StoryText30000,Even if they got <color=#FFFF00>extinct</color> in ancient times~
#StoryText30100,If you use <color=#FFFF00>origin DNA</color>, you can create any slaves or monsters, and you can also create <color=#FFFF00>large monsters</color> that got extinct.
#StoryText30200,<color=#FFFF00>Large monsters</color> require a <color=#FFFF00>dedicated cage</color> and <color=#FFFF00>dedicated breeding room</color> and breeding them <color=#FFFF00>takes a lot of work</color>, such as finding a special slave with <color=#FFFF00>Max Concurrent Fetuses</color> trait equal to <color=#FFFF00>3 or more</color>. That's why their <color=#FFFF00>price is very high</color>.

#StoryText30400,This is an elven slave sold by our company.
#StoryText30600,This is a furry slave sold by our company.
#StoryText30700,This is a small furry slave sold by our company.
#StoryText30800,This is a dragonian slave sold by our company.
#StoryText30900,I hope you enjoy breeding her.

#StoryText31000,A new product has been added.
#StoryText31100,It was difficult to secure.
#StoryText31200,<color=#FFFF00>Elves</color> are a magical race and have excellent physical strength. They are always at odds with dwarves. Also they value virginity and consider it shameful to lose it.<BR>Individual traits: <color=#63E057>Maintenance Cost -5G</color>, <color=#63E057>Max Health +15</color>, <color=#E07369>Conception Chance -5%</color>, <color=#E07369>Growth Time -5s</color>, <color=#E07369>Multiple Pregnancy -1</color>

#StoryText31300,It was pretty hard to find where they were hiding because they dig so deeply underground.
#StoryText31400,<color=#FFFF00>Dwarves</color> are a tribe with excellent physical abilities and recover quickly. They don't get along well with elves. Also they think it's a virtue to be prolific.<BR>Individual traits: <color=#63E057>Conception Chance +5%</color>, <color=#63E057>Maximum Births +3</color>, <color=#63E057>Multiple Pregnancy +1</color>, <color=#E07369>Growth Time +5s</color>, <color=#E07369>Maintenance Cost +5G</color>

#StoryText31500,It was pretty hard to catch them because they always running around in the woods.
#StoryText31600,<color=#FFFF00>Furries</color> are a multi-ethnic race. They are physically weak and evolved to spread their genes.<BR>Individual traits: <color=#63E057>Conception Chance +10% (All)</color>, <color=#63E057>Multiple Pregnancy +1(Cats)</color>, <color=#63E057>Growth Time -10s(Fox)</color>, <color=#E07369>Max Health -30(All)</color>, <color=#E07369>Growth Time +10s(Cats)</color>, <color=#E07369>Maintenance Cost +10G(Foxes)</color>

#StoryText31700,It was quite difficult to catch these hiding in the woods.
#StoryText31800,<color=#FFFF00>Small furries</color> are a multi-ethnic race. They are physically weak and evolved to spread their genes.<BR>Individual traits: <color=#63E057>Conception Chance +10% (All)</color>, <color=#63E057>Maximum Births +6(Bunnies)</color>, <color=#63E057>Maintenance Cost -10G(Sheep)</color>, <color=#E07369>Max Health -30(All)</color>, <color=#E07369>Growth Time +10s(Sheeps)</color>, <color=#E07369>Maintenance Cost +10G(Bunny)</color>

#StoryText31900,These were really hard to catch. 
#StoryText32000,<color=#FFFF00>Dragonians</color> are a strong race which prioritizes positive traits.<BR>Individual traits: <color=#63E057>Conception Chance +10%</color>, <color=#63E057>Growth Time -10s</color>, <color=#63E057>Max Health +30</color>, <color=#63E057>Maximum Births +6</color>, <color=#E07369>Maintenance Cost +10G</color>, <color=#E07369>Multiple Pregnancy -1</color>

#StoryText32100,It's hard to catch monsters this big.
#StoryText32200,<color=#FFFF00>Orcs</color> are slow to breed but their youths grow faster.<BR>Individual traits: <color=#63E057>Conception Chance +5%</color>, <color=#E07369>Breeding time +5s</color>

#StoryText32300,They are very rough, so please be careful while handling them.
#StoryText32400,<color=#FFFF00>Werewolfs</color> mating rate is very high and their children grow very fast.<BR>Individual traits: <color=#63E057>Breeding time -5s</color>, <color=#E07369>Slave's health consumption during breeding +0.05</color>

#StoryText09900,This slave has <color=#770000>died</color>.
#StoryText10000,Dead slaves <color=#FFFF00>decay</color> over time, spreading <color=#AA0000>diseases</color>.
#StoryText10100,Other slaves and monsters in the room may get <color=#AA0000>sick</color>.

#StoryText10200,Let's build a <color=#FFFF00>morgue</color> and bury the slave.
#StoryText10300,Build a morgue.
#StoryText10400,Move the slave to the morgue. 

#StoryText10500,When a room is contaminated, click the cleaning icon to disinfect it.
#StoryText10600,If there's no space in the morgue, <color=#FFFF00>Amilia can dispose of the body</color> for you.<BR>However, in this case, <color=#FFFF00>additional cost</color> is incurred.

#StoryText32500,Depravity of slave has risen a little, see?
#StoryText32600,The higher their depravity, the more obediently they will fulfill their duties.
#StoryText32700,Selling depraved slaves is also more profitable.
#StoryText32800,Good luck with achieving that.

#StoryText32900,Slaves have the state of depravity.
#StoryText33000,<color=#AE37FF>Depravity</color> increases through <color=#FFFF00>sex, childbirth, and milking</color>. Higher depravity increases the <color=#FFFF00>slave price</color> and <color=#FFFF00>offers for services</color> at the brothel. Those slaves also have their <color=#FFFF00>traits improved</color>.
#StoryText33100,Higher depravity makes it less likely for the slave to escape from the brothel. 

#StoryText33200,Slaves have various stats.
#StoryText33300,Monsters have various stats.
#StoryText33400,They all have a racial trait that is specific to each race.
#StoryText33500,In addition they have common traits that modify their stats.<br>Those traits can be inherited through mating.
#StoryText33600,If you use this knowledge well, you can breed the best offsprings.

#StoryText07400,The baby girl has grown up.
#StoryText07500,She can now get pregnant and give birth. However, she's still not fully grown.
#StoryText07600,Breastfeeding will help her mature.
#StoryText07700,She's now has a loli figure. If she drinks breast milk, she'll grow into a proper adult.
#StoryText07750,Drag and drop breast milk onto her.
#StoryText07800,<color=#FFFF00>Loli</color> has the <color=#FFFF00>same womb as adults</color> and can also be <color=#FFFF00>impregnated</color>, but their <color=#FF0000>health recovery is slow</color>.

#StoryText33700,<color=#FFFF00>Breast milk</color> has many uses, it can <color=#FFFF00>help a loli grow</color> or <color=#FFFF00>develop new traits</color> in slaves.
#StoryText33800,Let's try using the breast milk obtained this time.
#StoryText33900,Feeding a slave with breast milk has a chance to give them new traits or evolve existing.

#StoryText34000,Feed milk to the slave.
#StoryText34100,One of her traits has improved. In the same way, you can improve traits of any other slave.
#StoryText34200,So, go ahead and breed a race of super-slaves!

#StoryText34300,There is a monster that would be the main product of any trader worth their salt.
#StoryText34400,It's made by restoring an <color=#FFFF00>ancient monster</color> that went extinct from an <color=#FFFF00>origin DNA</color>.
#StoryText34500,First, give this <color=#FFFF00>goblin</color> to <color=#C27AEB>Flora</color> for <color=#FFFF00>dismantling</color>.
#StoryText34600,Did you get the <color=#FFFF00>origin DNA</color>?
#StoryText34700,If you give it to <color=#4DF4E4>Noel</color> next, you can <color=#FFFF00>remake the extinct monster</color>.
#StoryText34800,<color=#FFFF00>Origin DNA</color> is an item that comes out with a <color=#FFFF00>certain probability</color> when dismantling any monster or slave.
#StoryText34900,You can use it to remake all <color=#FFFF00>common monsters and slaves</color> as well as <color=#FFFF00>monsters that got extinct</color> in ancient times.

#StoryText35000,Have you made a large monster?
#StoryText35100,Large monsters require <color=#FFFF00>dedicated cages</color> and <color=#FFFF00>dedicated breeding rooms</color>.
#StoryText35200,And you also need <color=#FFFF00>special slaves</color> to breed them.

#StoryText35300,I'll give you one such special slave as a gift.
#StoryText35400,This slave could carry the child of a large monster.
#StoryText35500,Slaves with <color=#FFFF00>this ability of 3</color> can conceive and <color=#FFFF00>give birth to large monsters</color>.

#StoryText35600,Do you know about <color=#FFFF00>market prices</color>?
#StoryText35700,The <color=#FFFF00>market prices</color> change every <color=#FFFF00>night</color> and <color=#FFFF00>day</color>. Try to follow them.

#StoryText35800,You earn <color=#FFFF00>achievement points</color> when performing <color=#FFFF00>certain actions</color>.
#StoryText35810,You can use those <color=#FFFF00>achievement points</color> to <color=#FFFF00>upgrade abilities of NPCs</color>.
#StoryText35820,There's no order of upgrades, so you can choose what you want to upgrade first.

#StoryText35900,A variety of events occur depending on the player's actions.
#StoryText36000,Since many events interfere with play, play carefully to prevent them from occurring.

#StoryText36100,It's been a long time since I showed my ability.
#StoryText36200,Take that~

#StoryText36300,A slave got an <color=#FF0000>STD</color>.
#StoryText36400,Let's take care of it because if you leave her as is, the disease will spread and the value of your products will decrease.
#StoryText36500,<color=#FFFF00>Stock condoms</color> to prevent that from happening.

#StoryText36600,How about expanding your business from now on?
#StoryText36700,Let's remodel the empty above-ground space and use it as a <color=#FFFF00>brothel</color>.
#StoryText36800,You can now receive clients.

#StoryText36900,But first, let me introduce you to <color=#FFFF00>my colleagues</color>.
#StoryText37000,Sisters <color=#FFD158>Sena</color> and <color=#FFD158>Lena</color> are going to take charge of the brothel's <color=#FFFF00>management and sales</color>.
#StoryText37100,Good morning!
#StoryText37200,Good morning...
#StoryText37300,Then, let's make a brothel success together with them.
#StoryText37400,Come. Let's get started.

#StoryText37500,Well, I'll educate you.
#StoryText37600,Me and my sis will watch over the counter and <color=#FFFF00>guide customers</color> to the <color=#FFFF00>facility of their choice</color>.
#StoryText37700,If you want to profit more, I think it would be better to have a <color=#FFFF00>variety of facilities</color>...
#StoryText37800,We will sell <color=#FFFF00>condoms</color>!
#StoryText37900,Just in case, because they can <color=#FFFF00>prevent</color> <color=#AA0000>STDs</color> from spreading...
#StoryText38000,We will also sell <color=#FFFF00>LoveGel</color>!
#StoryText38100,It softens the insertion and <color=#FFFF00>reduces clients' sex duration</color>...
#StoryText38200,We sell unusual potions, too!
#StoryText38300,<color=#FFFF00>Cosmetic potion</color> can <color=#FFFF00>change appearance</color> of a slave or monster at any time...
#StoryText38400,Now, try building a facility.

#StoryText38500,It's our first client!
#StoryText38600,You have to put a slave in the facility so she can spread her legs for him.
#StoryText38700,We'll take care of the slaves' health, but it's not our responsibility if they run away...
#StoryText38800,So if you want to minimize the damage, you'd better assign slaves with a <color=#FFFF00>highest depravity</color>...

#StoryText38900,If clients like our girls, it will improve our <color=#FFFF00>reputation</color>. The more reputable we are, the <color=#FFFF00>more facilities and clients</color> you will have!
#StoryText39000,So watch your reputation. And don't forget to clean up from time to time!
#StoryText39100,That's it for our explanation. We're looking forward to working with you!
#StoryText39200,Don't forget about us...

#StoryText39300,You can <color=#FFFF00>change appearance of slaves and monsters</color> at will if you give them a Cosmetic Potion.
#StoryText39400,The new appearance from the potion is <color=#FFFF00>inherited by the next generation</color>.

#StoryText39800,Your reputation has improved slightly...
#StoryText39900,I'll arrange for a new service.
#StoryText40000,From now on, you can offer a service to clients who like bestiality.
#StoryText40100,Let's make an animal show room...
#StoryText40200,<color=#A77A23>Horse</color> is treated as a <color=#FFFF00>large monster</color>, and the <color=#FFFF00>same conditions as a large monster</color> are required for its pregnancy.
#StoryText40300,Sena and Lena will automatically sell the animal offsprings for a fixed price.

#StoryText40400,Your reputation has improved some more!
#StoryText40500,I'll arrange for the next service.
#StoryText40600,You can now serve clients who like to watch birth!
#StoryText40700,A room where you can display birth for money has been added.
#StoryText40800,They <color=#FFFF00>cannot give birth to monsters</color> there, only <color=#FFFF00>humans and animals</color> can give birth in the above-ground facilities.

#StoryText40900,Your reputation has improved even more...
#StoryText41000,Here's a new facility and service...
#StoryText41100,You can offer advanced services.

#StoryText41200,Your reputation has gone up a whole lot!
#StoryText41300,Here's a new facility and service...
#StoryText41400,VVIP room offer top-of-the-line service!
#StoryText41500,The VVIP room is a <color=#FFFF00>special facility</color> of which <color=#FFFF00>only one can be built</color> for the public.
#StoryText41600,It's a wealthy-exclusive facility where only <color=#FFFF00>fully deprave slaves</color>, that <color=#FFFF00>don't have any diseases</color>, can be deployed.
#StoryText41700,Up to <color=#FFFF00>two slaves</color> can be assigned, and the girls will dress up fancily.

#StoryText41800,You have a personal estate now. You can enter it by pressing the Estate button.
#StoryText41900,You can build facilities and place slaves or monsters in your personal estate just like in the work estate.
#StoryText42000,Resource consumption does not occur there, and other people do not come inside even if you build a brothel.
#StoryText42100,Instead, there is a Player character, which can be used to create illegitimate children, and bring them back to the work estate.

#StoryText42200,Before you return to work, let's decide on a name for the estate.
#StoryText42300,Please don't give it a dumb name, okay?
#StoryText42400,Come on, don't keep me waiting...

#StoryText42500,You're working hard.
#StoryText42600,I'll give you a slave as a gift.
#StoryText42700,This is a fallen dwarf princess.
#StoryText42800,She was expensive to acquire, but I will still give her to you.
#StoryText42900,Be sure to fill her belly with babies.

#StoryText43000,This girl was a stripper I cherished, but she's got in too much debt.
#StoryText43100,She could never make enough to repay me with just dancing...
#StoryText43200,But if I give her to you, so she could pay back her debt with her womb.
#StoryText43300,Make her birth lots of babies and I'll be satisfied.

#StoryText43400,It's been a long time since I've seen such a hard worker as you.
#StoryText43500,You know, I have needs too...
#StoryText43600,You may now service me sexually.

#StoryText43700,Thanks to you, my work has been successful.
#StoryText43800,As a gift, I will give you a new slave.
#StoryText43900,She's a pure-blood elf and the daughter of the tribe chief. She was my childhood friend, but...<BR>Now I can get my revenge on her for ignoring my pleas when they banished me.
#StoryText44000,My faeries kidnapped her on the night before her marriage.
#StoryText44100,Normally, I would have handed her to Amilia, but I'm offering her to you specifically.
#StoryText44200,Make her birth lots of monsters. Then put her in the brothel and make her birth more elves, then make them serve in the brothel all together!
#StoryText44300,...~Ahh!... *Ahem* ...I got excited. Now, let's get back to work.

#StoryText48600,Let me introduce you to a new <color=#FFFF00>business partner</color> from our organization.
#StoryText48700,Her name is <color=#FFFF00>Barbara</color>. She'll be in charge of <color=#FFFF00>room upgrades</color>.
#StoryText48800,Hi.
#StoryText48900,She can <color=#FFFF00>upgrade rooms by attaching different perks.</color>.
#StoryText49000,Call her whenever you need her.
#StoryText49100,Yeah, do call me.
#StoryText49200,Hi.
#StoryText49300,I'll teach you <color=#FFFF00>how to upgrade a room</color>.
#StoryText49400,<color=#FFFF00>Click here</color>.
#StoryText49500,<color=#FFFF00>Choose the room to upgrade</color>.
#StoryText49600,Then, <color=#FFFF00>the perk will be attached to the room</color>.
#StoryText49700,The more rooms you <color=#FFFF00>upgrade</color>, the more <color=#FFFF00>machines that increase the corruption</color> I'll make as a service.
#StoryText49800,Well then, good luck in the future, colleague.
#StoryText49900,<color=#FFFF00>Choose the room</color> you want to upgrade.
#StoryText50000,The room's <color=#FFFF00>perk</color> is attached randomly, and you can increase the <color=#FFFF00>number of perks up to three</color> through <color=#FFFF00>upgrades</color>.
#StoryText50100,You can <color=#FFFF00>adjust the perks through re-upgrade</color> and <color=#FFFF00>upgrade and re-upgrade consumes Gold</color>. Through <color=#FFFF00>upgrades</color>, you can <color=#FFFF00>reduce the consumption of Gold</color>.
#StoryText50200,I was able to make it thanks to your hard work on upgrades.
#StoryText50300,With this, you can <color=#FFFF00>easily increase slaves' corruption</color>.
#StoryText50400,Take it and install it wherever you want.
#StoryText50500,<color=#FFFF00>Install the torture chamber</color> wherever you want.
#StoryText50600,If you <color=#FFFF00>place a slave in the torture room</color>, their <color=#FFFF00>corruption will increase</color> by a certain number per second.
#StoryText50700,Thanks to you, I am earning so much.
#StoryText50800,I'll do you a service.
#StoryText50900,Amilia gave it to me, but it's useless.
#StoryText51000,I'll just gift it to you. Use  it well.
#StoryText51100,Oh, the profit was very good this time.
#StoryText51200,I'll give you something in return.
#StoryText51300,I picked it up on the way.
#StoryText51400,Use it.
#StoryText51500,After all, money is the best.
#StoryText51600,Thank you.
#StoryText51700,Now you can enjoy sex with Barbara.

#StoryText51800,There was a very strong smell of essence here.
#StoryText51900,Are you... the owner of this place?
#StoryText52000,Nice to meet you, I'm Rune.
#StoryText52100,I can make any wish come true if you give me <color=#FFFF00>essence</color>.
#StoryText52200,Of course, I can lend you my power only for the reasonable amount.
#StoryText52300,The mysterious girl, Rune, has come from another world.
#StoryText52400,She gains <color=#FFFF00>essence</color> from <color=#FFFF00>sex, milking, and childbirth</color> in the manor, and can exchange it for her <color=#FFFF00>abilities</color>.

#StoryText52500,Now, let me introduce you to just a few of my abilities.
#StoryText52600,It's the ability to <color=#FFFF00>resurrect the dead</color>.
#StoryText52700,Let me show you an example...
#StoryText52800,Do you have no dead bodies?
#StoryText52900,If you don't have one, I'll have to make one. Don't worry, I won't use someone from here.
#StoryText53000,<color=#FFFF00>Choose a corpse</color> to <color=#FFFF00>resurrect</color>.
#StoryText53100,<color=#FFFF00>The amount of essence required for each race is different</color>.
#StoryText53200,This is how you can bring the dead back to life.
#StoryText53300,I don't need this anymore...
#StoryText53400,Alright, time for the next ability introduction~
#StoryText53500,Let me introduce you to a very, very cute pet from our world, I call it <color=#FFFF00>tentacle</color>.
#StoryText53600,I wish you had a suitable room.
#StoryText53700,This size is just right for them, don't forget it.
#StoryText53800,To breed <color=#FFFF00>tentacles</color> you need their <color=#FFFF00>eggs</color>. I'll give you some in advance.
#StoryText53900,You can <color=#FFFF00>grow tentacles in the room</color> with them. I'll show you.
#StoryText54000,Let's breed some...
#StoryText54100,What a cute tentacles. They are really, really cute and useful creatures.
#StoryText54200,If you have them, it's <color=#FFFF00>very easy to collect essence</color>.
#StoryText54300,So I hope you make a lot.
#StoryText54400,Keep in mind that to create a tentacle, you need <color=#FFFF00>3 stacks of tentacle eggs</color> and <color=#FFFF00>some essence</color>.
#StoryText54500,Now go and <color=#FFFF00>make a few tentacle eggs</color>.
#StoryText54600,<color=#FFFF00>Try placing a slave in the tentacle room</color>.
#StoryText54700,Tentacles are really all-purpose, so when you put slaves there, you can collect essence without having to <color=#FFFF00>manage them</color>.
#StoryText54800,It will be convenient because <color=#FFFF00>sex, milking, childbirth are all handled in one place</color>.
#StoryText54900,Is the slave <color=#FFFF00>pregnant from a tentacle</color>? She is <color=#FFFF00>going to lay its eggs</color>.
#StoryText54950,Click on the tentacle eggs to retrieve them.
#StoryText55000,The collected eggs <color=#FFFF00>form a stack</color>, if you have <color=#FFFF00>three of them</color>, you can <color=#FFFF00>breed tentacles</color>.
#StoryText55100,Tentacle eggs are really multipurpose: they taste good, restore stamina, and also very useful material.
#StoryText55200,Go on, whether you want to <color=#FFFF00>sell them</color> or <color=#FFFF00>create new tentacles</color> is up to you.
#StoryText55300,If you give me those <color=#FFFF00>eggs</color>, I'll convert them to <color=#FFFF00>essence</color>.
#StoryText55400,When a slave is placed in the tentacle room, <color=#FFFF00>sex, milking, and childbirth</color> are all <color=#FFFF00>automatic</color>.
#StoryText55500,Also, <color=#FFFF00>slaves automatically receive care</color> when placed there.
#StoryText55600,In order to create a tentacle room, you need to <color=#FFFF00>convert breeding room</color>, <color=#FFFF00>3 tentacle egg stacks</color> and <color=#FFFF00>100 essence</color>.
#StoryText55700,That's about it. I'm tired from all this talking.
#StoryText55800,Good luck in the future.
#StoryText55900,You are free to gather all the essence for me.
#StoryText56000,Let me tell you about one of my special abilities.
#StoryText56100,If Rune collects <color=#FFFF00>666, special charges</color> of essence, something will happen.

#StoryText56200,Are you full?
#StoryText56300,Now, it's time for me to go back to my usual self.
#StoryText56400,As promised last time, I'll tell you one of my special moves.
#StoryText56500,Do you have a favorite among the girls here?
#StoryText56600,I'll <color=#FFFF00>brainwash</color> her so she can do whatever you wants.
#StoryText56700,Rune can <color=#FFFF00>brainwash an NPC</color> by consuming <color=#FFFF00>essence 666</color>. The brainwashed NPC will be <color=#FFFF00>placed in your personal territory</color> and can <color=#FFFF00>pregnant the player's child</color>.
#StoryText56800,However, for <color=#FFFF00>brainwashing</color>, <color=#FFFF00>NPC favorability must be Max</color> and <color=#FFFF00>Personal Territory</color> is required.

#StoryText56900,Who are you going to brainwash?
#StoryText57000,You can do whatever you want with them.
#StoryText57100,If you don't think it'll work because she doesn't like you, just try making her like you.
#StoryText57200,Trying to get a girl without a home?
#StoryText57300,Even rainwashing is not omnipotent.

#StoryText57400,Where did you get this from?
#StoryText57500,It is a very good quality mana stone.
#StoryText57600,If it's of this quality, it's probably worth more than <color=#FFFF00>5000 gold</color> on the market.
#StoryText57700,I don't know where you got this from, but anything that makes money is fine.
#StoryText57800,I will buy this mana stone for <color=#FFFF00>5000 gold</color> in the future.

#StoryText57900,Now... it's time to make the wish come true
#StoryText58000,What is this all about?
#StoryText58100,I never said it's <color=#FFFF00>your</color> wish that will come true.
#StoryText58200,You did a good job. Since it's useful, I'll take special <color=#FFFF00>management</color> of you.
#StoryText58300,Let's do our best in the future, partner.

#StoryText58400,You can buy private estate for <sprite index=1>50000 by clicking the Private Estate button.
